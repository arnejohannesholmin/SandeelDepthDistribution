Description: This package fits a mixture probability distribution to sandeel school vertical
  distribution data, where the sandeel are split into two behaviors, a resting
  behavior close to the sea bed modeled by the gamma distribution, and a
  feeding behavior higher in the water column modeled by the normal
  distribution.
